## First Note

Edit from macbook pro

$$
\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i · \beta)
$$

New text entered at Github inline math $\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i · \beta)$ here

This is my first text.

```{r}
rnorm(n = 10)
```

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
rnorm(n = 10)
```

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
